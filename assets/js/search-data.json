Section 8: Iteration 2.A Represent algorithmic processes without using a programming language. | 2.B Implement and apply an algorithm. | 4.B Determine the result of code segments | . | Section 10: Lists 2.A Utilize such as append and remove methods to mutate lists | 2.B Implement and apply an algorithm using iteration | 4.B Determine the result of code segments | . | . Planned Homework/Hacks . Section 8: Implement an algorithmic process with iteration to manipulate data Includes I/O | Write pseudocode | # Manipulate data and filter out odd numbers data = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10] new_data = [] for num in data: if num % 2 == 1: continue else: new_data.append(num) print(data) print(new_data) . | . | Example: Fibonnaci sequence using iteration by use of a while loop. | x = 2 # Uses a while loop to iterate through numbers of the fibonacci sequence and stops at the number that which is a factor of 12 while (True): x = x + (x-1) print(x) if(x % 12 == 0): break . | . | . | Section 10: Compare lists &amp; typical variables Access values by index | Useful for iteration | . | Can be mutated &amp; modified class_list = [&quot;rohin&quot;, &quot;rohin2&quot;, &quot;rohin3&quot;] # removes name from list if false is returned when called for name in class_list: if not bool(input(name)): class_name.remove(name) . | . | | . | .",
