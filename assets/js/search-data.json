Everything is sequencing for num in lst is iteration, as it iterates over the set list. if num % 4 == 2 is selection, as it selects for a specific value . Example 2 . for i in range(5): if i % 2 == 1: print(3) . 3 3 . Explanation . Everything is sequencing for i in range(5) is iteration, as it iterates over the range [1,5]. if num % 2 == 1 is selection, as it selects for a odd number . Video 2 . Find the value for a, b, c, d | a = 1, b = 7, c = 3, d = 7 | . What are the values of hot and cold after executing the code segment? | Hot = true, cold = true | . My Own Examples . { a = 1 b = 2 c = 3 d = 4 e = 5 result = a MOD b MOD c MOD d MOD e display(result) } . Answer: 1 mod 2 mod 3 mod 4 mod 5 = 1 . { a = 1 b = 2 c = a+b d = a+b+c e = (a+b+c+d)/(d-b) display(e) } . Answer: . c = 3 d = 6 e = 1+2+3+6/(6-2) = 12/4 = 3 . Concatenation .
