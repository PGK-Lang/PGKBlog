## Goals
 - Section 8: Iteration
   - 2.A Represent algorithmic processes without using a programming language.
   - 2.B Implement and apply an algorithm.
   - 4.B Determine the result of code segments
 - Section 10: Lists
   - 2.A Utilize such as append and remove methods to mutate lists
   - 2.B Implement and apply an algorithm using iteration
   - 4.B Determine the result of code segments

## Planned Homework/Hacks
- Section 8:
    - Implement an algorithmic process with iteration to manipulate data
        - Includes I/O 
        - Write pseudocode
    ``` 
    {
        # Manipulate data and filter out odd numbers

        data = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
        new_data = []

        for num in data:
            if num % 2 == 1:
                continue
            else:
                new_data.append(num)


        print(data)
        print(new_data)
    
    } 
    ```
    - Example: 
      - Fibonnaci using a list. Stop when the number is a factor of 12
